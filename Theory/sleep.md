# Sleep

Counterintuitively, sleep is a fundamental part of the learning process. When we sleep (particularly during deep sleep), our brain cells contract, and toxin removal happens. The clearance of the toxins is not just important from a health perspective; it can actually hinder our learning abilities.
Additionally, sleep is important because of its role in memory consolidation and cognitive processing. When we sleep, our brain actively processes and organizes information that we encounter during the day. This process helps solidify our memories, improve problem solving, and improve our learning outcomes.
Thinking a lot about a particular problem before sleep can even result in solving that problem during sleep.
This means that we need adequate and quality sleep to enhance our learning capabilities.

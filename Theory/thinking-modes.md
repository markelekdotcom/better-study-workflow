# Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking

In the realm of learning we differentiate between two modes of thinking.
Focused Thinking and Diffused Thinking.
By leveraging both, cycling between the two, we can significantly improve our cognitive abilities.

## Focused Thinking

Focused thinking is a cognitive process where you concentrate your attention on a specific task. In this mode your brain dedicates it's resources to that specific task allowing you to engage in problem-solving, analysis and deep comprehension.
This type of thinking cannot be sustained for long periods of time and can also lead to narrow thinking so it is crucial to balance it with Diffuse Thinking.
Intense focus can be generally sustained for around ~30 minutes.

### How to Focus More Effectively

- Taking notes during a live lecture can be very distracting especially if you copy everything which is a common mistake among students. Write down only the most important points/concepts and pay attention to understand the material.
- Utilize the Pomodoro technique to manage focused study sessions more effectively
- Create a distraction-free environment including both physical and digital distractions.
- Preferably study at quiet place, or use noise cancelling headphones.

## Diffused Thinking

Diffused thinking is a cognitive process which is associated with a more relaxed state. In this mode your mind wanders freely discovering new connections between seemingly unrelated concepts allowing you to see the big picture and think more abstractly. When you are stuck with a problem or need to be more creative, this is the thinking mode you want to engage in.

### How to Activate Diffused Thinking

Engaging in any activities that do not require much mental effort will activate this mode of thinking.

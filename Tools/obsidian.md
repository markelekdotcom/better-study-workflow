"Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way." - Wikipedia

Obsidian is a very powerful and highly customizable tool, thanks to its vibrant open-source community of plugins. As of 2023, it's available for free (forever) for personal use, according to its website. An ideal choice for implementing the study workflow.

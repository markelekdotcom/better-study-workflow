Espanso is a free, open-source, cross-platform text expander software.
It continuously runs in the background and allows you to type a short abbreviation basically anywhere and have it expanded into a full phrase, saving time and effort. Snippet templates can easily be created and shared with others.

Given Espanso's usefulness, cost-free availability, and cross-platform and time-saving nature, it is a great tool to have in our productivity arsenal.

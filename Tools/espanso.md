Espanso is a free, open-source, cross-platform text expander software.
It continuously runs in the background and allows you to type a short abbreviation basically anywhere and have it expanded into a full phrase, saving time and effort. Snippet templates can easily be created and shared with others.

Given Espanso's usefulness, cost-free availability, and cross-platform and time-saving nature, it is a great tool to have in our productivity arsenal.

Use the Anki snippet template found in the [../Templates](../Templates)  folder to quickly add Anki cards in Obsidian by typing `:anki` and pressing, then export them to Anki by using the *Obsidian_to_Anki addon* for Obsidian.

## Linter

Automatically lint your files to ensure a consistent style and structure.

Make sure to enable the *Inserts the file name as H1 heading if no H1 heading exists* option in the *Linter* addon settings under *H1 heading* > *File Name Heading*.

Additionally, set the folders you want to ignore, like the *Templates* folder, to avoid accidentally formatting your template files.

## Obsidian Git

Alternatively, you can just make local backups of your vault or pay for [Obsidian sync](https://obsidian.md/sync).

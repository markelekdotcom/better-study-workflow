# Obsidian Templates

These templates can be used to save time by creating a new note with a basic structure already in place. They can be used to create a new note by using the *Templater: Create new note from template* command in [Obsidian](../../Tools/obsidian.md) or you can set up a hotkey for it to save additional time. The templates can be found in the [Templates](./) folder in.

**Ensure that the Templater plugin is installed and enabled in Obsidian.**

## NoteTemplate

A basic note template with the current date, status, and tags.
There are two main sections: *Notes* and *Additional*.

No title section, as that will be automatically generated by the Linter addon for Obsidian.

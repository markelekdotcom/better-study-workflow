## Learning How to Learn Course - Coursera

This project started as the final project for the [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course on Coursera. The course is taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. It is a great course. I highly recommend it.
